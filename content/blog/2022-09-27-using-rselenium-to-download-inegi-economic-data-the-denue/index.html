<h2>Where are the docs at?</h2>
<p>The creator of the officeverse collection of packages, which officedown is a part of, is named David Gohel. He has a bookdown book with a chapter on officedown, but it is only about Word rather than PPT output:</p>
<p><a href="https://ardata-fr.github.io/officeverse/officedown-for-word.html" class="uri">https://ardata-fr.github.io/officeverse/officedown-for-word.html</a></p>
