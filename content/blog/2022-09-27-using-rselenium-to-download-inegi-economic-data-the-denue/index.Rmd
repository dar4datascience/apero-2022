## Where are the docs at?

The creator of the officeverse collection of packages, which officedown is a part of, is named David Gohel. He has a bookdown book with a chapter on officedown, but it is only about Word rather than PPT output:

For this reason alone, you may not realize you can use officedown to knit to PPT! I certainly didn't until my colleague [Christophe Dervieux](https://cderv.rbind.io/about/) gave me enough support to try it on my own.
